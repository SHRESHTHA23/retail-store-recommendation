# retail store recommendation

Business Case Scenario: A retail store has thousands of branches. They have a database of customer sale
data collected from the POS(Point of Sale) terminals. They have customers buying at a store as well as an
online system to order items for immediate delivery. Whenever a customer logs into the system, a list of
products need to be shown as recommendation to the customer. Based on the existing users and products
bought, recommend a list of products to the customer when the customer logs into the system. Note that
the recommendation is not based only on what the customer has bought before but also on what similar
customers have bought. This will use custom dataset and use ALS based recommendation algorithm of
Spark-MLLib.
